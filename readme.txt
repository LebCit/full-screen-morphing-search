Responsive Full Screen Morphing Search Page Overlay With Predictive Autocomplete !

== Description ==

= Full Screen Morphing Search =

Effect for any WordPress search input that morphs into a fullscreen overlay.  
Enlarge the search input and show 5 most recent posts, 5 most used categories and tags with counter.  
Once the input is clicked, the whole search element expands to a fullscreen overlay.  
The fullscreen overlay has a bigger search input.

There are no settings for this plugin. Simply activate it, click on any search input and see the magic happens !  
**PLEASE, MAKE SURE TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE POST WITH ONE CATEGORY AND ONE TAG BEFORE ACTIVATING**  

**As of version 2.0**, head over the Customizer, look for **FSMS Plugin**, design it as you want !  
You can change colors, search placeholder's text and default icons with a styling option !

== Installation ==

= How to install the plugin and get it working. =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Recent posts thumbnails are not round ! =

You will have to use a thumbnail regenerator.  
I recommend <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/" title="Regenerate Thumbnails" target="_blank">Regenerate Thumbnails</a>.

= The overlay is not covering the whole page ! =

If your theme has some boxed style(s), like Twenty Sixteen or Twenty Twelve,  
the overlay will only cover the inside box (the site content) !

= How to change the search input text color ? =

First, you'll have to type something in the input,  
then choose the desired color.  
Take a look at the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/full-screen-morphing-search/#screenshots" title="Screenshots">Screenshots</a>.

= How to change the shape of **New Icon/Image** ? =

First make sure that you have used a thumbnail regenerator, see first FAQ.  
Then, click on the checkbox option **Icon/Image Round or Not ?!**  
If the new Icon/Image is already round (like the default one of category anf tag), this option will have no effect !

= Autocomplete predicts only posts and pages ! =

Yes, just for now !  
I'll be adding some more cool functions with time.
